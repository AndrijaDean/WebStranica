                <h2>Rovaniemi</h2>
                <p>
                    Rovaniemi (/ˈroʊvəni.əmi/ ROH-və-nee-ə-mee,[6] Finnish: [ˈroʋɑˌnie̯mi] ⓘ; Northern Sami: Roavvenjárga [ˈroɑ̯vveˌɲaːrːka]; Inari Sami: Ruávinjargâ; Skolt Sami: Ruäʹvnjargg) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of Lapland.
                     It is located near the Arctic Circle in the northern interior of the country. The population of Rovaniemi is approximately 65,000, while the sub-region has a population of approximately 69,000. It is the 17th most populous municipality in Finland,
                     and the 12th most populous urban area in the country. Rovaniemi is also the largest city in Europe by land area.[7] <br> <br>
                    Rovaniemi is the administrative capital and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, Lapland, and its southern part Peräpohjola. The city centre is situated about 6 kilometres (4 miles)
                    south of the Arctic Circle and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the confluence of the river Kemijoki and its tributary, the Ounasjoki. 
                    It is the second-largest city of Northern Finland after Oulu, and, together with the capital city Helsinki, it is one of Finland's most significant tourist cities
                    in terms of foreign tourism.[8] <br><br>
                    The city and the surrounding Rovaniemen maalaiskunta (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi)
                    were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. Rovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of 65,000. 
                    The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53,361, in an area of about 59 km2 (23 sq mi). Rovaniemi is a monolingual Finnish-speaking municipality, 
                    and unusually for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the Swedish language.<br><br>
                    The coat of arms of Rovaniemi was designed by Toivo Vuorela. Its explanation is "in the green field, a silver pall with light-height upper branches;
                    accompanied by a golden flame in the upper corner".[9] It was approved on 15 August 1956 by the Rovaniemi Rural Municipal Council and confirmed on October
                    26 at the Ministry of the Interior as the coat of arms of the Rovaniemi Rural Council.[10]<br><br>

                <h2>Name</h2>
                <P>
                    The rova part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saami origin, as roavve in Northern Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of 
                    an old forest fire. The niemi part of the name means "cape".
                    The name of the town in the Saami languages spoken in Finland are Inari Sami: Ruávinjargâ, Northern Sami: Roavenjárga and Roavvenjárga and Skolt Sami: Ruäʹvnjargg.

                <p>
                    Periodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practice of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750–530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from Karelia in the east,
                     Häme in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The Sami are indigenous to Sápmi.<br><br>
Rovaniemi is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture
 and animal husbandry—with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots.<br><br>
The exploitation of Lapland's natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth.
 Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, 
 Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.<br><br>
The township decree was promulgated on 27 June 1928, as a result of which Rovaniemi seceded from the old rural municipality as its own market town on 1 January 1929.[11]<br><br>
