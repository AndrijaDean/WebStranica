                <h1>Levi Ski</h1>
                <p>Levi is a fell located in Finnish Lapland, and the largest ski resort in Finland.
                    [1] The resort is located in the village of Sirkka, Kittilä municipality and is served 
                    by Kittilä Airport and Kolari railway station. At a latitude of 67.8° north, it is located 
                    approximately 170 km (110 mi) north of the Arctic Circle.<br><br>
                    The peak of the Levi fell is at an elevation of 531 metres (1,742 ft) above sea level. There are 43 ski slopes 
                    (17 of which are floodlit) and 27 ski lifts in Levi. Ascending the fell are 2 gondolas, 1 chairlift, 14 T-bar 
                    lifts, 5 stick lifts, 4 rope tows, and 1 magic carpet for children. Levi is one of two locations of gondola lifts 
                    in Finland, and has been chosen as the best domestic skiing resort in Finland four times.[2]<br><br>
                    Levi is an early stop on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit, hosting slaloms in mid-November;[1] the races in
                    2019 were held slightly later (November 23–24). With snowmaking, the climate provides a reliable early season 
                    technical venue in Europe, prior to the late autumn events in North America.<br><br>
                    The slopes in Levi are mostly suitable for beginners or intermediates, but there are also three black slopes for
                    experts. The highest vertical drop is 325 m (1,066 ft) and the longest slope is 2.1 km (1.3 mi) in length. 
                    The longest ski lift is about 1,636 metres (1.017 mi) long. Levi has one superpipe, one halfpipe, two streets, 
                    two snow parks, 10 free children's slopes and seven slope restaurants.<br><br>
                    The skiing and snowboarding season in Levi is fairly long, often lasting from October to mid-May. The ski school
                    provides instruction in downhill skiing, snowboarding, telemark skiing and cross-country skiing. Cross-country 
                    skiers have illuminated ski tracks and snow that lingers well into the spring. There are 230 km (140 mi) of 
                    cross-country skiing tracks and 886 km (550 mi) of snowmobiling tracks in Levi.<br><br>
                    The resort's latitude, north of the Arctic Circle, usually guarantees generous snow cover and sub-freezing 
                    temperatures (< 0 °C (32 °F)) throughout winter. It also allows for excellent chances of observing the 
                    Northern Lights. Although very popular in winter, Levi is very quiet in the summertime, yet still a good 
                    base location for exploring the surrounding areas.<br><br>
                    At 8 km (5 mi) from the centre of Levi is Luvattumaa, Levi Ice Hotel & Ice Gallery; 45 km (28 mi) from 
                    Levi is the Snow Village Lainio, where one can view snow and ice buildings, eat in an ice restaurant 
                    (in Lainio), or experience a night's sleep in an ice room.<br><br>
